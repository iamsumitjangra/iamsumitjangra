People often think money is the most important thing. Others who have money say time is the most important. But do we really know what is most important and necessary? A few days ago I finished Man's search for meaning and I'll suggest it a must-read. For those who don't know, it's a masterpiece written by Victor E. Frankl - a Psychiatrist, based on his own and his patient's experiences in Nazi death camps. During this time he also introduced logotherapy (logos is the Greek word for meaning). <br /><br />So what is logotherapy and how it is beneficial? According to Victor Frankl, the primary human drive is not pleasure but the pursuit of what we find meaningful. Whether we have money or time, if we do not have meaning in life, we will not find happiness. <br /><br /> Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'.<br /> - Friedrich Nietzsche <br /><br />We all can see in our daily life that one event can be very joyful for one person, and at the same time, it can taste bitter to someone else. It all depends on if that event provides any meaning to us. So how can we possibly find what is the meaning of our life? Obviously, it's not written somewhere (Apart from religious books, but since I am more of an atheist, we will leave that part). In the book, he gave many examples of people who just gave up their meaning and after that did not have any drive to survive. In 2003, Aron Ralston, who survived a canyoneering accident by cutting off his own arm, himself said that his love for his family was the reason which made him fight for his survival. Meaning to your life can be derived from anything, your love for family and friends, helping other people, building a company to solve a problem at a large scale, etc. But the problem arises when you are no longer to do what gives you meaning. That time remember one thing, when we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves. One can take everything from you but one thing: your attitude in any given set of circumstances. In Nazi death camps too, people who wanted to see their family or a scientist who wanted to finish a word he couldn't finish were the ones to survive. Once you let go of the reason which provides you meaning, there is no hope. <br /><br />There was one more example. An old man was very sad in his life as his wife died. He thought of remaining life just as suffering. But he was told that what if he died earlier than his wife. In that case, his wife has to suffer. So basically his suffering was the price he was paying so that his wife did not have to suffer. At that moment his perception changed towards what he was calling as suffering. In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.<br /><br />So It does not really matter what we expect from life, but rather what life expected from us. We need to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who are being questioned by lifeâ€”daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.
